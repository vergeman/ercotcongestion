# compute/runs/

Canonical artifact tree for pipeline outputs. One subdirectory per `run_id`. The
directory itself is gitignored (only this README is tracked) — runs are local
working state, not source.

Each run owns a self-contained set of artifacts keyed by `<run_id>`, with stage
subdirs that mirror the source package names (`congestion`, `matrix`,
`clustering`). A run produced by the orchestrator (`compute/run_pipeline.py`)
also carries `meta.json` (provenance: git sha, dates-file SHA-256, per-stage
status + elapsed) and a copy of the dates file it consumed.

```
compute/runs/<run_id>/
  meta.json                       # orchestrator provenance
                                  # (run_id, created_at, dates-file SHA-256, git sha, per-stage status/elapsed_s)

  reference_dates.json            # copy of the dates file used (provenance)
  <stage>.log                     # captured stdout+stderr, one per stage

    mapping_basis_summary_<run_id>.json
    mapping_cca_<run_id>.json                   # CM.3 — canonical correlations

    scorecard_series_<run_id>.npz               # per-hour model_Z / ercot_Z
  clustering/
    summary.json
    cluster_labels_<ref>_<algo>_k<K>.npz        # bus_id → cluster_id (per sweep row)
    zones_<ref>_<algo>_k<K>.geojson             # optional cluster polygons
```

## Which run reaches the API / frontend

The API reads run artifacts off the `./compute:/compute` bind mount — no ingestion.
Two independent selection paths:

* **API (topology + ercot state)**: env vars in `.env.dev`, resolved at container
  create time. `ACTIVE_RUN_ID` picks the run; `ACTIVE_CLUSTER_ALGO` /
  `ACTIVE_CLUSTER_K` / `ACTIVE_ERCOT_REF` select which artifact within it.
  Change means `docker compose up -d api` (not `restart`) + `rm api/static/topology.json`.
* **Frontend (validation panel)**: `VITE_RUN_ID` in `.env.dev`, passed as the
  `run_id=` query param to `/validation`. Change means `docker compose restart web`.

The two must match, or the map bakes labels from one run and the scorecard panel reads another.
